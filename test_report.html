        <h2>Top Five Cyber Threats</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Critical Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows</h3>
                <p>The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has added a critical vulnerability in Microsoft Windows, tracked as <strong>CVE-2024-35250</strong>, to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog. This vulnerability allows attackers to escalate privileges from local to admin, potentially granting full system access. Organizations are urged to apply patches before the January 6, 2025 deadline to mitigate risks.</p>
